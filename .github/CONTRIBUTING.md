# Contributing #

**<center>Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project.</center>**

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of conduct ##

By contributing to this project, you agree to conform yourself to the [GSRI Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

*Please take the time to read that document and ensure you accept to conform with these rules (which are not mere guidelines).*

## License ##

This project is protected by the  [MIT license](../LICENSE) which terms you should have read and accepted. By contributing to this project, you place all the content you provide under the protection of this license.

## Guidelines ##

* **Communicate in english.** We are a french community, but our aim is to contribute to the whole community. Using english helps players from other countries reuse our tools and enhance them.

* **Respect coding styles.** Both official and informal ones. This helps to keep readability and maintenance and reasonable levels.

* **Comment your code.** Be reasonable on the amount though, and remember that code is about hows and comments about whys. If you're code has no comments or a lot of them, you're probably doing something wrong.

* **Coordinate with the community.** This will prevent you from wasting energy on a topic already being worked on or focus on more critical matters. The best place to coordinate is on our [GSRI official discord server](https://discord.gg/bhMn4jd)

## Contributing to Github issues ##

The most common way of contributing to our projects is by contributing to the issues tracking system.

### Before creating an issue ###

* **Ensure you have the latest version** of the product. If not, upgrade your product and ensure the issue still occurs or the feature you'd like is still missing
* **Seek help on our Discord**. Perhaps you're misusing the product or there's something missing elsewhere.
* **Look for an existing issue**, including closed one, to avoid issue duplication.

### Creating a new issue ###

* **Fill the provided template** in order for us to get as much information as needed to solve your problem or implement the requested feature.
* **Be as precise as possible** in your descriptions, provide screenshots, animated gifs and log files whenever possible.
* **Keep in mind that feature requests might be denied.** We have our own agenda and sometimes, features requested are not as critical as others to us. You may still fork our project to implement the feature, and even provide a pull request if you want (see below).

### Contribute to existing issues ###

* **Do not reply to issues**, unless you have informations to provide. If you want to testify that you face the same issue or back an existing feature request, add a `+1` reaction emoji on the original post instead. This helps keep the conversation log clean.
* **Read the whole conversation log before replying**. If you found an existing closed issue for your feature, and it's not available in the product, then it was rejected by the community. Please read the feature request carefully for explainations on why.
* **Do not ask for feature request reopening** on GitHub. Come to Discord and have a chat with us. You may also fork the project to add your feature.

## Providing pull requests ##

If you want to contribute to the codebase while not being a member of the community, you may request a pull from your own fork of the project.
